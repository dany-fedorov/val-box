# Publishing val-box

Publishing is always an explicit maintainer action. No package script publishes
or writes authentication configuration.

1. Verify the exact checkout:

   ```sh
   npm run check
   git status --short
   ```

2. Preview the package and inspect the listed files:

   ```sh
   npm pack --dry-run
   ```

3. Create the release artifact locally:

   ```sh
   mkdir -p .artifacts
   npm pack --pack-destination .artifacts
   ```

4. Authenticate locally and verify the account:

   ```sh
   npm login --registry https://registry.npmjs.org/
   npm whoami --registry https://registry.npmjs.org/
   ```

5. Publish the exact inspected tarball explicitly:

   ```sh
   npm publish ./.artifacts/val-box-0.1.0.tgz --access public --registry https://registry.npmjs.org/
   ```

Never put an npm token in repository files, committed shell transcripts, or
chat. npm supports granular access tokens; for automated releases, use an npm
trusted publisher with OIDC instead of a long-lived token when the hosting
workflow is ready.

Package names and versions cannot be reused after publication, even if a
release is later unpublished. Confirm the package name, version, tag, and
tarball before the final command.
